The research in the Wimmer Lab is focused on understanding the cognitive and neural systems underlying learning, memory, and decision-making.

Our emphasis is broadly on understanding "the things that our brains have stored" that influence our choices.

Our areas of research focus on:

1. **Goal-directed decision making**: How we form the representations of our environment, and use memories of episodes, to pursue our goals.
2. **Value-based decision-making**: How well-learned associations – such as those acquired and remembered over days – guide our behavior.
3. **Emotion & Decision-making**: How natural and clinically-relevant variations in emotion shape our decision-making.

### Technologies and methods
Our research uses in-lab behavioral studies, large-scale online behavioral studies, MEG, fMRI, and in the future, OP-MEG.

We strive to develop experiments that can illuminate core functions underlying our everyday behavior, with an aim toward informing the study of dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders.

### Joining the Wimmer Lab
**The lab is new and growing! We welcome your interest.**
