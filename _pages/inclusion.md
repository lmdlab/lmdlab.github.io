# Diversity and inclusion

At the LMDlab, our mission is to create an inclusive and diverse scientific research environment where everyone can feel valued and respected. We believe that diversity and inclusion are key to our success as a research group, and are committed to creating an environment that is free of discrimination and bias.

We recognize that diversity is essential to fostering innovation, creativity, and growth. We are committed to creating a research group where individuals from all backgrounds and experiences are welcomed and celebrated. We are dedicated to providing a safe and supportive environment for our staff and students, where everyone can be their authentic selves. We embracing the unique perspectives and skills of our group members, and we strive to promote a workplace where everyone can contribute to their fullest potential.

We believe that diversity and inclusion should be integrated into all aspects of our research, from our recruitment and selection processes, to our working environment, and to how we conduct our research

At the university level, UCL is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion through our hiring practices and ensuring that our recruitment process is fair and equitable. UCL is also committed to providing a range of training, development, and mentoring opportunities to ensure that everyone has access to the same opportunities to advance their careers.
