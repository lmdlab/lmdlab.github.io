# About this website

Our website is based on the open source templates designed and shared by the lab of Stephan Sanders, itself based on shared code from the labs of [D. Allan Drummond](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/misc/about/). We downloaded source codes from their repository and modified our contents based on shared templates. We greatly thank for Allan and Trevor for allowing reuse of their codebase. 

The website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://lmdlab.github.io) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lmdlab). Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the original sources of the lab website template).
